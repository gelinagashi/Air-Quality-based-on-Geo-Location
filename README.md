Air Quality Based on Geo-Location
This dataset provides information on air quality measurements for different pollutants such as ozone (O3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in various locations around the world. The dataset can be used by researchers and policymakers to understand trends in air pollution levels and inform interventions to improve air quality and protect public health. Air quality is deteriorating in many cities worldwide, and the increase in pollution levels, industrial emissions, and other factors contribute to this effect. By monitoring air quality through this dataset, analysis can be performed, and a model can be created to assess air quality based on location.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Unique ID: A unique identifier assigned to each row in the dataset.
Indicator ID: A code assigned to each air quality indicator or measurement tracked.
Name: The name or label given to the tracked indicator or measurement.
Measure: The unit of measurement used to define the air quality indicator, such as parts per billion (ppb) for ozone or sulfur dioxide.
Measure Info: Additional information regarding the measurement or calculation of the air quality indicator, if applicable.
Geo Type Name: The type of geographic zone being tracked, such as community districts (CD) or municipalities.
Geo Join ID: A unique identifier assigned to each tracked geographic zone.
Geo Place Name: The name of the specific geographic zone being tracked, such as Coney Island or Bronx.
Time Period: The time period during which the air quality measurement was taken, such as a specific season or winter of a given year.
Start Date: The date when the measurement period started.
Data Value: The value of the air quality indicator for the specific geographic zone and time period being tracked.
Message: Additional information or notes regarding the air quality measurement or data value, if applicable.
Algorithms Used
The following algorithms will be used for analysis:

Decision Tree
Random Forest
Linear Regression
test_training_with_linear_regression.py
This code performs a linear regression analysis on a preprocessed air quality dataset. The code uses the pandas library to load the dataset and select the necessary columns, which are the start date and data value. The start date column is converted to a numerical format, which is required for regression analysis.

The sklearn library is used to split the data into training and testing sets. The data is split at an 80:20 ratio, where 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing. Then, a linear regression model is created and fitted with the training data.

The model is then used to predict the values for the test data, and the coefficients and intercept of the linear regression model are printed to the console. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using the mean squared error and R2 score.

In general, this code demonstrates how to perform a basic linear regression analysis on a dataset using Python and the sklearn library. The code can be easily adapted to work with other datasets, making it a useful tool for data analysis and machine learning.

Results:
Coefficient: [-2.75440897e-08]
Intercept: 57.18908890792791
Mean Squared Error: 409.33047279103437
R2 Score: 0.027400427668851424

First, the required libraries are imported, including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, and scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.

Next, the code loads a preprocessed dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame using the read_csv method.

The data is then preprocessed by dropping missing values using.
